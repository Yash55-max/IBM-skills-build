Researchers, students, and professionals often struggle to stay updated with the
rapidly growing volume of academic publications, technical articles, datasets,
and evolving research trends. Manually reviewing, filtering, and synthesizing
information across multiple domains is time-consuming and inefficient.
Proposed Solution:
An AI Research Agent that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG), to assist users in conducting efficient literature
reviews, generating summaries, identifying research gaps, and recommending
relevant papers, datasets, or collaborators.

TECHNOLOGY USED:-
